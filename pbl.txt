DESCRIPTION:

tom - console , uses geocode start/end addresses using tomtom, 
-requests routing alternative with traffic from tom routing api
scans time window upto 60 mins interval to find bfd(best departure time )
uses folium map saved as routes_map.html , color-coded by traffic (used to draw maps)
supports only car ,if bike it fallbacks to car cuz bike routes aren't available 

stream - ui inputs(start,end,window,interval,route )
uses tom geocode + routing through cached functions, then gives bfd across window and stores them in dataframe and alternatives 
displays interactive folium map inside stream, route card and alternative selection , line grph (plotly chart for travel-time vs departure -time)
uses history csv for later visualization 

 tech
python
tomtom api's(geocoding/search, routing)
https - requests library 
folium for map and polyline overlays
streamlit and streamlit_folium for web ui 
plotly.express for interactive charts in stream 
pandas for csv history and data frame handling
date, time , pytz(python lib for accurate timezone calculations using time zone database called "tzdata") for timezone aware time stamps in ist
os file operation to save and check csv history 

api's - geocoding for coordinates for an address 
routing 
alg and logic - geocoding , fetching routes (single call) , bfd(core alg),
(sample start/end -> fetch routes and travel time -> store it  -> show best route+charts).

data model and files - history_journey.csv

limitation -  api's, network related , can lag for long searches kani avadhu cuz Hyderabad varaku eh vundhi kabati
